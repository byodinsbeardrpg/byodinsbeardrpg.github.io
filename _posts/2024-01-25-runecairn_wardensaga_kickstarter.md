title: 'Runecairn Wardensaga Remastered is Live on Kickstarter'
---

I'm currently launching a refreshed and updated version of Runecairn Wardensaga on Kickstarter!

[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/byodinsbeardrpg/runecairn-wardensaga-remastered](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/byodinsbeardrpg/runecairn-wardensaga-remastered)

#### What’s new in Wardensaga Remastered?

- Sleek new layout, making it clearer to read and play.
- Tightened up and clarified mechanics, to better convey to new players and GMs.
- Brought in new mechanics introduced in the **[Runecairn Bestiary](https://byodinsbeardrpg.com/books/runecairn_bestiary/)** like toxic and dismembered status effects.
- Provided answers to common questions like “how do I increase mead flask sips?”, “what do rare items mean?”, and “where should I place bonfires when playing solo?”.
- Brilliant new colour and texture for the illustrations, alongside all new illustrations like the dwarf and lindworm.
- Typo and corrections pass to squash those bugs once and for all.
