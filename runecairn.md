## Overview

***The gods have fallen
Fresh life blooms from the ruin
Fate is yours to weave
Death Is Not The End***

**Runecairn** was written with the following design philosophies in mind:

**Neutrality**

The Warden's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

**Classless** 

A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences defines their specialty.

**Death**

Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.

**Fiction first** 

Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the Warden in dialogue with players, based on in-world elements.

**Growth** 

Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

**Player choice** 

Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

**Principles** 

The Warden and players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.



### Adventures

What type of adventures can player characters expect?

- **Defend** a village against roving invaders

- **Hunt** a monstrous creature stealing children

- **Reclaim** a family cairn overwhelmed by the dead

- **Retrieve** a powerful relic lost in the mountains

- **Confront** a raging jotunn blocking supplies reaching an isolated settlement

- **Broker** peace between two warring clans

- **Protect** a caravan journey travelling through dangerous territory

- **Infiltrate** a secretive cult worshipping forgotten gods

- **Explore** newly discovered lands in search of a mythical beast



## Principles

### **Principles for Wardens**

**Information**

* Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it
* Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances
* Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions
* Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions

**Difficulty**

* Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics
* If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll will allow them to do it
* Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen
* Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions

**Preparation**

* The game world is organic, malleable and random - it intuits and makes sharp turns
* Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not stories or plots
* NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the world
* NPCs don't want to die - infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality

**Narrative Focus**

* Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities - give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization
* Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path
* A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your heavy armour and impressive training

**Danger**

* The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player characters
* Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present - the more dangerous, the more obvious
* Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution
* Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world

**Treasure**

* A Treasure is specific to the environment from where it is recovered - it tells a story
* Treasure is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige
* Relics are not Treasure, though they are useful and interesting
* Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes

**Choice**

* Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls
* Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague
* Work together with this conversational progress to keep the game moving
* Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world

**Die of Fate**

* Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the weather, unique character knowledge, etc.)
* In these situations, roll 1d6 - a roll of 4 or more generally favours the players
* A roll of 3 or under tends to mean bad luck for the PCs or their allies



### Principles for Players

**Agency**

* Attributes and related saves do not define your character - they are tools
* Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too
* Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections

**Exploration**

* Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have
* Take the Warden's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information
* There is no single correct way forward

**Talking**

* Treat NPCs as if they were real people and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems
* You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent

**Caution**

* Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals
* Try to stack the odds in your favour and retreat when things seem unfavourable

**Planning**

* Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding
* Do some research and ask around about your objectives

**Ambition**

* Set goals and use your meagre means to take steps forward
* Expect nothing - earn your reputation
* Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens



### Principles of the World

**The Nine Realms**

* The realms are full of danger and wonder
* There are echoes of the old world everywhere
* Travel between the realms is perilous and rare

**The Gods**

* The Aesir and the Vanir are all dead or missing
* Mjölnir is lost and Gungnir is broken
* The Jotunn are scattered, most fled to Jotunheim

**The Titans**

* The Sons of Fenrir wander hungry and feral
* Jörmungandr is dead, his skeleton long picked clean
* Strange new titans roam unchallenged and dominant

**Bonfires**

* The light of a bonfire will always lead you to safety
* Bonfires link the Nine Realms
* The flames of a bonfire will never dwindle

**Secrets**

* Secrets are worth seeking out but all are well guarded and dangerous
* Some mysteries will never be solved

**Magic**

* Magic is wild and unpredictable, with behaviour changing from one realm to another
* The use of magic draws unwanted attention

**Defeat**

* If one path leads to defeat, try another way
* Some obstacles cannot be overcome immediately
* With every defeat comes new knowledge and opportunities

**Death**

* Spirits gather in places of the dead
* Remnants of the wars wander as shades, all humanity and vigour lost
* Death is not the end



## Character Creation

**1. Name**

Choose or roll a name for your character from the **Names tables**.

Next, roll for the rest of your character's traits (appearance, speech, personality, etc.) on the **Character Traits** **tables**.



**2. Ability scores**

Roll **3d6** for each ability in order, swap any two.

1. **Strength (STR)**: Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.
2. **Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves requiring agility, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.
3. **Wits (WIT)**: Used for saves to interrogate, investigate, provoke, manipulate spells, etc.
4. **Spirit (SPI)**: Used for saves to charm, self-control, intimidate, persuade, belief, etc.



**3. Vigour**

Roll **1d6** for your starting **Vigour** score. Vigour determines your self-determination, drive, and focus. Vigour is what stands between you and the hollow void.

You lose one point of vigour at death. If your vigour drops to **0**, you become a **shade**, a hollow being neither dead nor alive, and are lost to the darkness.



**4. Vitality**

Roll **1d6** to determine your **Vitality**, how hale and hearty you are.



**5. Resilience (RES)**

**Resilience** is your ability to avoid damage in combat. Resilience is made up of **Vitality** and **Vigour**. Add the two stats together to get your **Resilience**.

If your **Resilience** drops below 0, you start taking **STR** **damage**. If that happens, prepare to die.



**6. Starting class**

Determines **initial equipment** and **skills**.

Each background has a **key ability** and **key item**. Your key item adds new skills. Change your class by picking up a new key item, if you meet the requirements.

You can only carry one key item at a time.

***Your starting class does not determine what type of character you are. What you were does not dictate who you can be.***



### Starting Classes

#### **Warrior**

In another life you might have been a soldier, a guardsman, a shieldmaiden, or a raider. Your shield was always strapped to your arm and your axe and spear always to hand.

You sang the songs of battle and drank to victory and defeat in smoke-filled halls.

In combat, you favoured the direct approach, relying on your sturdy armour to deflect any blows while giving you time to land your own.

In the time before you prayed to Oðinn for a glorious death but now your fate is your own to choose.

#### **Skald**

In another life you might have spoken for the dead, burned sweet sacrifices to the gods, wandered the land weaving tales of myth and legend.

Your voice spoke for all and none. You deciphered the will of the gods and shone their light on the people of the realms.

In combat, you wielded the fury of the gods, whether thunder or steel. Your toughened reindeer hide helped deflect all but the sharpest spears and your voice itself was said to shake mountains.

Although the time of the gods is done, you still work their will and wield their power. How you choose to use it is now in your hands alone.

| Skald (SPI, 2 DEF) |                                |

| Steel sword        | d6                             |
| Saga               | Cure Wounds or Lightning Spear |

#### **Scout**

In another life you might have been a hunter, an archer, a scoundrel, or an explorer. With a pair of sharp knives and a trusty shortbow, you easily made your way in the world, whether in untamed wilderness or cut-throat civilisation.

You found the paths and trails no-one else could, weaving your way through danger and adventure at every turn. Your fast reflexes helped save you in situations where your quick tongue could not.

In combat, you either slipped in close, unnoticed, or struck silently from afar with unerring accuracy.

Even in the time before you forged your own path. Now that your fate is truly unwritten, the Nine Realms are yours for the taking.

| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Hunting knives     | key, d6        |

| Elm shortbow       | bulky, d6, 60’ |
| Fire oil           | blast, d8      |
| Skeleton key       | small          |
| Free slots         | 5              |

*Skills:*

**Dash (reaction, key item):** Deftly evade an attack; **DEX** save to avoid all damage – failing the save **impairs** the enemy's attack, reducing it to **d4** (**Fatigue**)

**Volley (shortbow):** Fire two arrows without hesitation -- roll damage die twice (**Fatigue**)

* **Dire strike:** Fire another arrow and roll another damage die

  

#### **Seer**

In another life you might have been a wise woman, an augur, a trickster, or a conjurer. The only things you needed were your wits and a hunger for knowledge. You sought to delve the mysteries of the realms and pluck forth the secrets within.

You stayed in the shadows, called on for your counsel and power. Mistrusted by some, feared by others, and respected by all.

You were never much for combat, preferring to work your cunning to rain destruction or mischief on your foes from a safe distance.

The gods are dead but their secrets are still waiting under ash and weald. You've seen your future and it's filled with endless possibilities.

| Seer (WIT, 0 DEF) |                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Yew staff         | key, d4             |

### Character creation example

New tabletop role-playing gamer Amy wants to create a character in ***Runecairn***.

Amy starts by rolling on the female names table and gets **54**, Lind. Amy likes the sounds so decides to keep it.

Amy doesn't know much about Lind at this point, so she rolls on the character traits tables and gets the following results:

She's **brawny**, with **dark skin**, **braided hair**, and a **sharp face**. She's **eloquent**, **ambitious**, and **deceitful**.

Lind is starting to take shape in Amy's mind.

Amy rolls **3d6** four times and assigns the results to her abilities:

**STR** 9
**DEX** 10
**WIT** 14
**SPI** 16

With a Spirit of 16 Lind would make a good **skald**, so Amy chooses that starting class.

She switches her **DEX** and **WIT** scores to give her Skald more dexterity and ends up with these final abilities:

**STR** 9
**DEX** 14
**WIT** 10
**SPI** 16

Amy generates Lind's **Resilience** (**RES**) score next. She rolls a **d6** for Lind's **Vigour** and gets 3.

Amy then rolls a **d6** for **Vitality** and gets 4.

Adding the two rolls up, Lind the Skald has **7** **Resilience**.

The Skald class starts with the following equipment:

* Runic focus (key item) (small)
* Reindeer hide armour (1 Defence)
* Leather hood (+1 Defence)
* Steel sword (d6)
* Saga: cure wounds or lightning spear (choose 1)
* Sacred waters
* Sacrificial bundle (small)

Her two pieces of armour (reindeer hide and leather hood) gives her a total **defence** of **2**.

Her **key item** is a runic focus, which allows her to cast magic in the form of **sagas**. Amy has the choice of either a healing tale (**cure wounds**) or a tale of Thor the thunder god (**lightning spear**). She thinks that Lind would be a follower of Thor and takes lightning spear.

Lind wields a *steel sword* that does d6 damage and fills out the rest of her inventory with helpful items like *sacred waters* and a *sacrificial bundle*.

With her starting equipment stowed or worn, Lind has **5 free inventory** **slots** that she can use to **loot items**, **cast spells**, or **take reactions** in combat. None of her items are bulky so they only take up one slot each. **Small** items don't take up any space.

**Sagas** don't take up physical slots but instead take up space in Lind's mind as the tales are dense and elaborate.

Lind also has a flask filled with **Iðunn's mead**, which heals her injuries and helps to clear **Fatigue**. She starts with **two sips** of mead.

Amy's now finished creating her new skald, Lind, who's equipped and ready to set off into a strange new world.



## Concepts of Play

**Resilience**

Resilience (**RES**) is the ability to avoid damage in combat, representing your personal drive, toughness, instinct and survivability.

Resilience is calculated by adding two stats: **Vigour (d6)** and **Vitality (d6)**. Damage reduces your **Resilience** and **drinking mead** or **resting at a bonfire** restores it.

If an attack takes your **Resilience** exactly to 0, roll on the **Omens** **table**.

**Defence**

Before calculating damage to **Resilience**, subtract the target's **Defence** value from the result of **physical damage** rolls. Shields and similar armour provide a bonus (e.g. +1 Defence), but only while the item is held or worn.

**Magic** bypasses mundane armour - **Defence** doesn't reduce **magical damage**.

Wearing heavy armour weighs you down. If you're wearing **bulky** armour, make all **DEX** saves at **disadvantage** due to the cumbersome nature.

**Inventory**

* You start with **10 inventory slots**
* Most items take up **1 slot** and **small** items don't take up any
* **Bulky** items take up 2 slots and are two-handed or awkward to carry
* Anyone with a **full inventory** (all slots filled) is reduced to **0 Resilience**
* You can't carry more items than your inventory allows

**Saves**

A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. Roll a d20 for an appropriate ability score. If you roll *equal to or under that ability score*, you pass. Otherwise, you fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

In some situations, saves are made with a bonus (**advantage**) or penalty (**disadvantage**). Roll two d20s, take the lower result for **advantage** and the higher for **disadvantage**.

**Mead flask & healing**

Filled with mead brewed by the gods and infused with the Iðunn's everlasting apples, sipping this mead restores health and heals injuries.

One sip takes an action and restores **10** **RES** and clears **2 points of** **Fatigue**. The flask is replenished when resting at a bonfire.

You start with **2 sips**. The amount of mead in the flask can be increased under the right circumstances.

Your **mead flask** does not take up any inventory slots.

**Status effects**

* **Cursed: Resilience** is halved until the curse is lifted or otherwise dispelled
* **Deprived:** You can't **recover Resilience** or take **reactions** until you rest at a bonfire
* **Poisoned:** Take damage every turn, bypassing **DEF**; a successful **STR** save or resting at a **bonfire** cleanses the poison

**Fatigue**

Your actions and items weigh heavily on you and **Fatigue** can easily overwhelm.
**Fatigue** is caused by casting **spells**, using certain **skills**, and rare **monster abilities**.
Each **Fatigue** occupies **1 inventory slot** and lasts until the character rests at a **bonfire**.

**Clearing Fatigue**

During a moment of calm, you can spend **1 soul** to clear d4 points of **Fatigue** (see **Souls**).

You can also attempt to clear **Fatigue** through introspection, such as reflecting on your ancestors, meditating in nature, or singing a song to lift your spirits.

Roll a **d6** and compare the result to your current **Vigour** score. If you roll under (**success**), clear that many points of **Fatigue**. If you roll over (**failure**), you lose **1 point of Vigour**.

You can attempt to **clear** **Fatigue** in this manner once per day.

**Bonfires**

Bonfires link the Nine Realms and offer a beacon of hope to souls lost in the dark.

Resting at a bonfire restores all lost **Resilience**, clears all **Fatigue** from your inventory, and resets **ability** score loss.

Resting at a bonfire also causes most slain foes to return to life. Powerful or intelligent foes such as **gods**, **jotunn**, or **dragons** are not reborn in this manner and remain dead when defeated.

When resting at a bonfire, you can choose to spend **Souls** to grow your power.

**Death**

Prepare to die often. Upon death, you wake at the last bonfire rested at with all your current items.

**Lose** one point of total **Vigour** for every death. If your total **Vigour** reaches 0, your character is forever lost to the darkness.

One point of **Vigour** can be restored by a full day communing with a **skald** or by burning a **sacrificial bundle** at a bonfire.

**Souls**

The might of the gods has been scattered across the Nine Realms. Fragments of this power exist as **soul remnants**, energy manifested and crystallised into physical form.

You may discover **Soul remnants** in hidden and secret places, in areas of great power, or under the watch of fearsome guardians. **Soul remnants** are **small** and take up no inventory space.

Powerful beings such as **jotunn**, **dragons**, or **demons** may also be imbued with the scattered essence of the gods. Overcoming these foes, through combat or other means, grants you ephemeral slivers of this power: **souls**.

Breaking a **soul remnant** will imbue you with the souls held within.

**Souls** are delicate and are discarded when you die. You have one chance to recover dropped **souls** after you wake up at the bonfire. Die again before retrieving them and they're lost forever.

**Spending souls**

As **souls** represent the innate power of the gods, you can absorb this power to grow stronger.

When resting at a bonfire, you can focus on the imbued power and enhance your might.

While resting, spend 1 soul to permanently increase one of the following attributes: **STR**, **DEX**, **WIT**, **SPI**, or **Vitality**.

Rare merchants and travellers trade in souls and you can barter for goods and services with **soul remnants**. Certain spells or relics can also coalesce **soul remnants** from imbued **souls**.

**Wealth & treasure**

Gold and most coins have little value and most trade is through barter.

Treasure takes the form of weapons, armour, spells, or relics. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.

## Combat

**Rounds**

* Roughly ten seconds of in-game time
* Comprised of **turns**

**Actions**

* **Move up to 40ft**, **cast a spell**, **attack**, **move again**, or other reasonable action
* Declare actions before rolling dice; if risky, the Warden calls for a save
* All actions, attacks, and movements occur simultaneously

### **Reactions**

* PCs can **react** to an enemy attack and attempt to either **block**, **deflect**, **avoid**, or otherwise mitigate damage
* Some reactions are only available through **key items** or **relics**

All PCs have the following reactions:

* **Roll:** Make a **DEX** save to roll away from an enemy's attack, avoiding **all damage** (causes **Fatigue**)
* **Withdraw:** Make a **DEX** save to disengage from combat and retreat, **avoiding all damage**; failing the save means you escape but still take damage from the attack

**Turns**

The Warden telegraphs the actions taken by NPCs or monsters.

If surprised at the start of combat, the PC makes a **DEX** **save** to act before their opponents.

Failing this save also means PCs can't use a **Reaction** in their first turn.

### **Attacking & damage**

* Attacks lower **Resilience** but damage is reduced by **Defence** (**DEF**)
* Roll weapon die and subtract **DEF**; deal remaining to the target's **Resilience**
* **Magic** bypasses **mundane armour** but not **magical armour**
* Unarmed attacks always do **1d4** damage.

### **Attack modifiers**

**Damage advantage**

Attacks from a position of strength (against a helpless foe or through a daring manoeuvre). Roll for damage twice and take the **higher result**.

**Damage disadvantage**

Attacks from a position of weakness (through cover or with bound hands). Roll for damage twice and take the **lower result**.

Certain skills or items can also grant **damage advantage** or **disadvantage**.

**Multiple attackers**

If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result (**damage advantage**).

**Dual and 2-handed weapons**

If attacking with two weapons at the same time or one weapon held in both hands, gain **damage advantage**.

### **Dire strike**

Some weapons or enemies have special abilities that are triggered when rolling **max damage,** such as rolling 10 on a d10.

The Warden may also decide the effect of a dire strike.

**Blast**

Blast attacks affect all targets in the area, rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite.

If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the damage die for a result.

**Ability score loss**

If any of a PC's ability scores are reduced to 0, they die.

Ability loss is reset when resting at a bonfire or by certain magic or items.

### **Critical damage**

* Once a target reaches 0 **RES**, additional damage reduces **STR** directly and triggers a critical damage save
* The target must roll under **STR** to avoid critical damage (this includes PCs, NPCs, and monsters); any target that fails a critical damage save dies

### **Death**

On death, characters wake up at the last bonfire rested at. They keep all inventory items but drop unspent souls at the location of their death.

Resurrected characters can retrieve these dropped souls if they reach this location without dying again. Dropped souls are permanently lost at death if not retrieved.

### **Omens**

Omens are messages from spirits, the gods, or the land and can represent fortune or favour.

When an attack reduces a PC's Resilience to exactly 0, this triggers an omen. Roll a d8 on the Omens table to determine the event and outcome.

| Omens |                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | A spirit appears to you in the form of an animal. Make a **SPI** save. If you pass, the animal accompanies you until dawn of the next day. |
| 2     | Roiling storm clouds gather overhead and a you glimpse a winged shape within. Make an **INT** save. If you fail, you flee from the shape in terror. |
| 3     | The ground trembles and shakes as if a titan approaches. Make a **DEX** save. If you fail, you're knocked to the ground. |
| 4     | A ghostly figure emerges from the wilderness and shrieks before fading away. Make a **STR** save. If you fail, you lose most of your hearing until the next day. |
| 5     | You hear the hushed murmur of a thousand voices whispering in unknown tongues. Make an **INT** save. If you pass, you gain insight into the future. |
| 6     | As if the dead of winter, you see your breath billow in a misty cloud as the heat drains from your body. Make a **STR** save. If you fail, gain 2 points of fatigue from the cold. |
| 7     | A lank hooded man in a wide-brimmed hat appears on the horizon, beckoning you forward. Make a **SPI** save. If you fail, you follow the hooded man into a trap. |
| 8     | You hear the howl of an enormous wolf rolling across the landscape, followed by echoing calls in response. Make a **DEX** save. If you pass, the wolves can’t find you. |



### Combat example

***Lind the skald** enters a darkened ruin, overgrown and ancient. The corridor leads north and figures are heard shuffling.*

**Amy:** I walk further down the corridor, steel sword in one hand and runic focus in the other.

**Warden:** Further down the ruin you see an armoured form wandering aimlessly. Its skin is decayed and drawn and it's holding a rusted spear. It's a **draugr** and it hasn't spotted you yet.

**Amy:** I'm going to run up and cut it down with my sword!

**Warden:** OK, you rush forward and slash at the undead warrior. Roll your damage.

*Amy rolls a 5 on her **d6.***

**Warden:** The draugr has **1 defence** from its armour so it takes 4 damage. The draugr turns and raises its spear to attack!

**Amy:** I gather my will and unleash the power of the gods through my voice! I shout NO!

*Choosing to use Lind's **shout** skill as a **reaction** to avoid the attack, Amy rolls a d20 and **attempts** to roll under her **SPI** of 16. She gets 5, a success!*

**Warden:** You emit a shockwave and knock the draugr off balance, deflecting the attack! Tick one **Fatigue** for the shout.

*Amy does and she now has **4** **slots** left.*

**Amy:** This thing's not so tough. I strike out with my sword!

*Amy rolls a 4 on her **d6** for the attack.*

**Warden:** The draugr takes 3 damage -- it's not looking very good! It snarls and thrusts its spear.

**Amy:** I'll take the hit since I've got decent **defence**.

*The warden rolls a 5 on his **d6** for damage. He subtracts Lind's defence rating of 2 from the **damage**.*

**Warden:** Oof! You take 3 points of damage.

**Amy:** Grr, that's it. I clutch the runic focus tightly and weave a tale of Thor the thunderer. **Lightning spear**!

*Amy rolls a **d8** for damage for her spell and gets a 5. She marks another point of **Fatigue** for the spell.*

**Warden:** Magic bypasses the draugr's armour therefore it takes full damage. Because the attack reduces its **RES** below 0, it takes the remaining 4 damage to its **STR**. The draugr now needs to make a **critical damage** **STR** save or die!

*The warden rolls 16 on a **d20**, failing to roll under the draugr's new **STR** score of 7.*

**Warden:** It crumples to the ground, a blackened husk from the lightning strike. You've defeated it!

**Amy:** Yes! Does the body have anything on it?

**Warden:** Before you can search, the spell you just cast draws the attention of another **draugr**. It shuffles out of the darkness, holding a rotted **shortbow**. Roll a **DEX** save to see if you can react quick enough to avoid it!

*Amy rolls a 16 on her **d20**. Failure, since her **DEX** is 14!*

**Warden:** You try to step back but aren't quick enough and the arrow strikes you in the arm.

*The warden rolls a d6 for damage and gets 4. He subtracts Lind's defence.*

**Warden:** You take **2 damage**. A second draugr shambles out next to the first, spear in hand. What do you do?

**Amy:** They're undead right? I throw my bottle of sacred waters at them!

Amy rolls a **d10** twice for damage, one for each draugr, and gets 9 and 4. Amy updates her character sheet to remove the sacred waters from her **inventory**, freeing up a **slot**.

**Warden:** The bottle breaks on the first draugr's armour and splashes over them both for magic **blast** damage. The first takes 9 points, bringing it under 0 and reducing its **STR** by 1.

*The warden rolls a 1 on the draugr's critical damage save.*

**Warden:** A critical success! The first draugr is still up but at -1 **RES**.  The second sizzles as it takes 4 points of damage. Both lurch forward, spears raised! Unless you avoid it, they'll hit with **damage advantage** since its two on one.

**Amy:** I grip the runic focus and scream a curse from the gods, using my **shout** to deflect the attacks.

*Amy makes a **Spirit** save by rolling a **d20**. A failure at 18! She ticks another **Fatigue**.*

**Warden:** You struggle to remember the tale and the shout fails to deflect the attack.

*The warden rolls a d6 twice for the spear attacks and gets 6 and 6.*

**Warden:** Bad luck, a **dire strike**! One of the spears strikes your abdomen and the other pins you to the ground. You can't move for one turn.

*He subtracts Lind's defence.*

**Warden:** You take 10 damage.

**Amy:** I'm at -8!

**Warden:** You lose 8 points of **Strength**. Make a **critical damage** save to see if you stay on your feet!

*Amy rolls a **d20**, hoping to beat her newly reduced **STR** score of **1**. **Natural 20** ! A critical failure!*

**Warden:** You died! The draugr watches your lifeless body collapse to the ground and it slowly lurches away. The world fades to black...

...

... You awaken at a roaring bonfire. Your wounds are healed but you lose **1** point of **Vigour**.

*Amy marks her sheet, cursing her bad luck. She has **3 Vigour** left. Her total Resilience is now reduced to 6.*

**Amy:** This means the draugr I killed are back alive – er, on their feet again, doesn't it?

**Warden:** That's right. But at least now you have a better idea what to expect.

*Amy furrows her brow and grips her pencil tighter.*

**Amy:** Let's do this!



## Magic

Magic is a remnant of the gods and draws attention when used. Some see magic as proof the gods live on in the new world.

**Runestones**

Smooth and delicately polished stones with an inscribed spell hand-etched in runes. Used by seers to affect magical change in the world.

**Sagas** 

Not a physical object, but a learned and memorised tale passed down from the gods. Skalds can recite sagas to channel the power of the gods through speech.

Runestones and sagas contain a single spell and take up one slot. They cannot be transcribed or created; instead they are recovered from places like tombs, dungeons, and ruins.

Scrolls are similar to runestones and sagas, however:

* They do not take up inventory slots.
* They do not cause **Fatigue**.
* They disappear after one use.

**Casting spells**

**Seers** cast spells by holding a **runestone** in one hand and a staff in the other. They read the **spell** from the runestone and focus the magic through the staff.

**Skalds** cast spells by holding a **runic focus** and speaking the **saga** aloud.

Casting both types of magic takes a toll. After every spell, add a **Fatigue** to inventory, occupying one slot.

Given time and safety, you can enhance a spell (e.g., affecting multiple targets, increasing its power, etc.) without any additional cost.

If **deprived** or in danger, the Warden may require you to make either a **WIT** or **SPI** save (depending on the spellcaster) to avoid any ill-effects from casting.

Consequences of failure are on par with the intended effect, and may result in added **Fatigue**, the destruction of the **runestone**, the **saga** slipping from memory, injury, or death.

Only spells that cause **Fatigue** are subject to ill effects.

**Relics**

Items imbued with a magical spell or power. They do not cause **Fatigue**. Relics usually have a limited use, as well as a recharge condition. A few examples:

- **Eye of Oðinn**, 1 charge. Crystalline orb with brilliant red flaw. Grants a glimpse into a chosen realm. Recharge: Bathe the Eye in the tears of a god.
- **Mischief Horn**, 3 charges. Delicate curved bronze horn. Blow to cause two random people within the sound of the horn to swap bodies for a day.
- **Mistletoe Dart**, 1 charge. Vibrant leaves conceal a wickedly sharp thistle. When thrown, flies to any named target but lands harmlessly before them. Recharge: Witness a kiss of true love.
- **Skull Beacon**, 1 charge. Charred and crumbling skull with a dim glimmer in the sockets. Glows brightly when held. Recharge: burn on a roaring bonfire.
- **Staff of Walking Weald**, 1 charge. Crooked staff speckled with soft moss. Temporarily animates a plant or tree. Recharge: bury underneath the oldest tree in the forest for one week.

**Rings**

Many magical rings may be found but none of them should be used lightly.

Characters can wear up to two rings at a time, one on each hand.

A few examples:

- **Iron Ring**. Dense ring wrought from blackened iron. Gain 1 additional defence but lose 10 speed.
- **Red Berserkr Ring.** Crudely shaped bone ring with a glinting rough cut ruby. Reroll 1s on damage dice for melee attacks but lose all defence bonus from armour.
- **Ring of the Mists.** Exquisite Dwarven-crafted silver ring carved with undecipherable runes. Allows the bearer to travel between the realms of the living and the dead but draws the attention of untold horrors.
- **Sylva's Ring.** Delicate wooden ring entwined by sharp thorns. Gain 2 extra inventory slots but lose 1 vigour.
