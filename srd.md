##  Overview

### What is Runecairn?

**Runecairn** is a Norse fantasy tabletop roleplaying game intended for two players, the **Warden** (the facilitator or game master) and the **Adventurer**.

For **solo play** or for two or more Adventurers, please see **Advanced Rules**.

### Design Philosophy

***Neutrality.*** The Warden’s role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

***Classless*.** An Adventurer’s role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences defines their specialty.

***Death*.** An Adventurer may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.

***Fiction first*.** Dice do not always reflect an obstacle’s difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the Warden in dialogue with the player, based on in-world elements.

***Growth*.** An Adventurer is changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving hazards and overcoming obstacles.

***Player choice*.** A player should always understand the reasons behind the choices they’ve made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

***Principles.*** The Warden and Adventurer each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

### Adventures

What type of adventures can a player character expect?

- **Defend** an isolated village against roving invaders.

- **Hunt** a monstrous creature stealing lost children.

- **Reclaim** a family cairn overwhelmed by the hungry dead.

- **Retrieve** a powerful relic lost in the frozen mountains.

- **Confront** a raging jotunn blocking supplies reaching a remote settlement.

- **Broker** peace between warring clans.

- **Protect** a caravan journey travelling through dangerous territory.

- **Infiltrate** a secretive cult worshipping forgotten gods.

- **Explore** newly discovered lands in search of a mythical beast.



## Principles of the Warden

**Information**

- Provide useful information about the game world as characters explore.

- The player doesn’t need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.

- Be helpful and direct when answering player questions.

- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and let them know they can ask questions.

**Difficulty**

- Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.

- If something the player wants to do is impossible, no roll can change this.

- Does the player’s approach to a situation make sense? Let it happen.

- Saves cover many uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

**Preparation**

- The world is malleable and random— it intuits and makes sharp turns.

- Use random tables and generators to develop choices, not stories or plots.

- NPCs remember what the Adventurers say and do.

- Infuse NPCs’ self-interest and will to live into their personality.

**Narrative Focus**

- Emergent experience matters, not maths or Adventurer skills. Provide weapon trainers and personal quests to foster improvement and specialisation.

- Observe player needs and wants, then provide realistic opportunities.

- A dagger to the throat is fatal, regardless of armour or training.

**Danger**

- The game world produces real risk of pain and death.

- Telegraph danger when present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.

- Put traps in plain sight and let players generate a solution.

- Provide chances to solve problems and interact with the world.

**Choice**

- Provide a solid choice forcing outcomes when the situation lulls.

- Use binary “so, A or B?” questions responding to vague intentions.

- Collaborate the conversational progress, keeping the game moving.

- Ensure Adventurer actions leave their mark on the world.

### Die of Fate

- Occasionally you want an element of randomness (for changing weather, unique character knowledge, roadside encounters, etc.):

- Roll d6: 3 or less favours the player, 4 or more means bad luck.



## Principles for the Player

**Agency**

- Attributes and saves do not define your Adventurer—they’re tools.
- Don’t only ask what your character would do but what you would do.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

**Exploration**

- Asking questions and listening is more useful than stats, or skills.
- Take the Warden’s description without suspicion but don’t be afraid to seek more information.
- There is no single right way forward.

**Talking**

- Treat NPCs as real people, relying on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- Most people are interesting and want to talk things through before getting violent.

**Caution**

- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence helps reach your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favour and retreat from adverse situations.

**Planning**

- Avoid obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

**Ambition**

- Set goals and use your meagre means to take steps forward.
- Expect nothing—earn your reputation.
- Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.



## Principles of the World

**The Nine Realms**

- The battle of Ragnarok is over, the worlds long broken.

- Danger and wonder is everywhere.

- Echoes of the old world remain.

- Travel into other realms is perilous.

**The Gods**

- The Aesir and the Vanir are dead or missing.

- Mjölnir is lost and Gungnir is broken.

- The Jotunn are scattered, most fled to Jotunheim or realms unknown.

**The Titans**

- The Sons of Fenrir wander hungry and feral.

- Jörmungandr is dead, their skeleton long picked clean.

- Strange new titans roam unchallenged and dominant.

**Magic**

- Magic is wild and unpredictable, with behaviour changing from one realm to another.

- The use of magic draws unwanted attention.

**Bonfires**

- The light of a bonfire always leads you to safety.

- Bonfires link the Nine Realms.

- The flames of a bonfire never dwindle.

- Bonfires are kindled by the dead.

**Secrets**

- Secrets are worth seeking out but all are well guarded and dangerous.

- Each secret reveals more of the world.

- Some mysteries can never be solved.

**Defeat**

- When one path leads to defeat, try another.

- Some obstacles cannot be overcome immediately.

- With every failure comes new knowledge and opportunities.

**Death**

- Spirits gather in places of the dead.

- Remnants of the wars wander as shades, all humanity lost.

- Death is not the end.

### The Viking Age

Though inspired by the actual Viking Age (roughly 800-1200 CE), the realms of Runecairn exist in a Norse fantasy world brimming with mythology and folklore, ever changing and evolving.



## Adventurer Creation

**Name & traits**

Choose or roll your Adventurer’s **name** and determine pronouns.

Next, roll your **traits** (appearance, personality, etc.).

**Ability scores**

| Strength  | Brawn,  toughness, and resistance.  |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Dexterity | Agility,  sneaking, and reflexes.   |
| Wits      | Intellect,  memory, and cunning.    |
| Spirit    | Resolve,  charm, and force of will. |

Roll **3d6** for each in order, swap any two.

**Vigour**

Roll **d6** for your **Vigour**, which is your drive, self- determination, and focus and is what stands between you and the hollow void.

You lose 1 point of vigour at death. At 0 Vigour, you become a **shade**, a hollow being neither dead nor alive lost to the darkness.

**Vitality**

Roll **d6** to determine your **Vitality**, how hale and hearty you are.

**Resilience (Res)**

**Resilience** is your ability to avoid damage in combat. Add **Vitality** and **Vigour** to get **Resilience**.

If your **Resilience** drops below 0, you start taking **Str** damage. If that happens, prepare to die.

**Background**

Provides **initial equipment** and **skills.**

Each background has a **key ability** and **key item**. Your key item adds new **skills**. Change your playstyle by picking up a new key item, if you meet the requirements.

You can only carry **1** key item at a time.



##  Backgrounds

### Warrior

In another life you might have been a soldier, a guardsman, a shieldmaiden, or a raider. Your shield was always strapped to your arm and your axe and spear always to hand.

You sang the songs of battle and drank to victory and defeat in smoke-filled halls.

In combat, you favoured the direct approach, relying on your sturdy armour to deflect any blows while giving you time to land your own.

In the time before you prayed to Oðinn for a glorious death but now your fate is your own to choose.

**Warrior (Str, 3 Def)**

| Ash wood spear     | d6, 20’, thrust           |
| Memento of defeat  |                           |
| Free slots         | 4                         |

**Skills**

***Disarm*.** Hook your opponent’s weapon hand; target needs to make a **Dex** save or be disarmed (**Fatigue**).

***Hack*.** Attack your opponent in a frenzy for **double damage** (**Fatigue**).

- **Dire strike**: Your opponent must make a **Str** save or stagger from the ferocity of the attack, moving back 5’ and losing their next turn.

***Parry (reaction)*.** Deflect an incoming attack and riposte (**Str**):

- **Success:** Avoid all **physical damage** and retaliate for **damage advantage.**

- **Failure:** Retaliatory attack from the target at **damage advantage**.

***Thrust*.** Lunge forward to extend the range of your weapon and strike targets up to **10 feet** away (**Fatigue**).



### Skald

In another life you might have spoken for the dead, burned sweet sacrifices to the gods, wandered the land weaving tales of myth and legend.

Your voice spoke for all and none. You deciphered the will of the gods and shone their light on the people of the realms.

In combat, you wielded the fury of the gods, whether thunder or steel. Your toughened reindeer hide helped deflect all but the sharpest spears and your voice itself was said to shake mountains.

Although the time of the gods is done, you still work their will and wield their power. How you choose to use it is now in your hands alone.

**Skald (Spi, 2 Def)**

| Runic focus        | key, small, scold, shout    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Reindeer hide      | 1 Def                       |

| Steel sword        | d6, sunder                  |
| Saga               | *Heal* or *Lightning Spear* |
| Sacred waters      | d10, blast                  |
| Sacrificial bundle | small                       |
| Free slots         | 5                           |

**Skills**

***Scold*.** Manifest cutting words to wield as a dagger or throw at opponents for **d4** damage, 20ft range.

***Shout (reaction)*.** Your voice propels a shockwave that staggers a foe within **melee range**; **Spi** save to disrupt an attack and take no damage (**Fatigue**).

***Sunder*.** Tear through your opponent’s armour for **d4 damage**; first occurrence causes target to lose **1 Def** (**Fatigue**).

***Heal* (saga).** Call upon the remaining power of the gods to heal your wounds; restore **10 Resilience** and clear the **Deprived** condition (**Fatigue**).

***Lightning Spear* (saga).** Summon a crackling bolt of lightning; strike your foe for **d8 damage**, 60ft range (**Fatigue**).



### Scout

In another life you might have been a hunter, an archer, a scoundrel, or an explorer. With a pair of sharp knives and a trusty shortbow, you easily made your way in the world, whether in untamed wilderness or cut-throat civilisation.

You found the paths and trails no-one else could, weaving

your way through danger and adventure at every turn. Your fast reflexes helped save you in situations where your quick tongue could not.

In combat, you either slipped in close, unnoticed, or struck silently from afar with unerring accuracy.

Even in the time before you forged your own path. Now that your fate is truly unwritten, the Nine Realms are yours for the taking.

**Scout (Dex, 1 Def)**

| Hunting knives | key, d6, backstab, dash, lacerate |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Quilted cloth  | 1 Def                             |

| Fire oil       | blast, d8                         |
| Skeleton key   | small                             |
| Free slots     | 5                                 |

**Skills**

***Backstab***. Duck behind your enemy and inflict a critical strike (**Dex**):

- **Success:** Strike your target for **double damage.**

- **Failure:** Retaliatory attack from the target at **damage advantage.**

- **Dire strike:** Follow up with an extra attack that bypasses defence.

- **Success:** Avoid **all damage.**

- **Failure: Impair** the enemy’s attack, reducing to **d4 damage.**

***Lacerate*.** Slice a deep wound in your enemy for an initial **d6 damage;** roll **d4** to determine bleed damage and duration (**Fatigue**).

***Volley*.** Fire two arrows without hesitation—roll damage die twice (**Fatigue**).

- **Dire strike:** Fire another arrow and roll another damage die.



### Seer

In another life you might have been a wise woman, an augur, a trickster, or a conjurer. The only things you needed were your wits and a hunger for

knowledge. You sought to delve the mysteries of the realms and pluck forth the secrets within.

You stayed in the shadows, called on for your counsel and power. Mistrusted by some, feared by others, and respected by all.

You were never much for combat, preferring to work your cunning to rain destruction or mischief on your foes from a safe distance.

The gods are dead but their secrets are still waiting under ash and weald. You’ve seen your future and it’s filled with endless possibilities.

**Seer (Wit, 0 Def)**

| Yew staff        | key, d4, barrier, clobber, greystone |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Stout linen      | small, 0 Def                         |
| Runestone        | *Slow* or *Seiðr Spear*              |
| Bleached jawbone | -                                    |

- **Success:** Raise a magical shield to negate all damage from the attack.

- **Failure:** Impose **damage disadvantage** on the target’s attack.

***Slow* (spell).** Slows nearby enemies (**Fatigue**).

***Seiðr spear* (spell).** Propel a spear of pure energy; strike your foe with the spear for **d10 damage**, 60’ range (**Fatigue**).



## Adventurer Creation Example

> New tabletop roleplaying gamer Amy wants to create an Adventurer in ***Runecairn***.
>
> Amy starts by rolling on the names table and gets **57**, *Lind*. Amy likes the sound so decides to keep it.
>
> Amy doesn’t know much about Lind at this point, so she rolls on the Adventurer traits tables and gets the following results:
>
> She’s **brawny**, with **smooth skin**, **braided hair**, and a **sharp face**. She’s **eloquent**, **ambitious**, and **deceitful**.
>
> Lind is starting to take shape in Amy’s mind.
>
> Amy rolls **3d6** four times and assigns the results to her abilities:
>
> **Str** 9, **Dex** 10, **Wit** 14, **Spi** 16
>
> With a Spirit of 16 Lind would make a good **skald**, so Amy chooses that background.
>
> She switches her **Dex** and **Wit** scores to give her Skald more dexterity and ends up with these final abilities:
>
> **Str** 9, **Dex** 14, **Wit** 10, **Spi** 16
>
> Amy generates Lind’s **Resilience (Res)** score next. She rolls a **d6** for Lind’s **Vigour** (4).
>
> Amy rolls a **d6** for **Vitality** (5).
>
> Adding the two rolls up, Lind the Skald has **9 Resilience.**
>
> Her two pieces of armour (*reindeer hide* and *leather hood*) give her a total **defence** of **2**.
>
> Her **key item** is a *runic focus*, which allows her to use magic in the form of **sagas**. Amy has the choice of either a healing tale (***Heal***) or one of Thor the thunder god (***Lightning Spear***). She thinks that Lind would be a follower of Thor and takes lightning spear.
>
> Lind wields a *steel sword* that does d6 damage and fills out the rest of her inventory with helpful items like *sacred waters* and a *sacrificial bundle*.
>
> With her starting equipment stowed or worn, Lind has **5 free inventory** slots that she can use to **loot items**, **cast spells**, or **take reactions** in combat. None of her items are **bulky** so they only take up one slot each.
>
> **Small** items don’t take up any space.
>
> **Sagas** don’t take up physical slots but instead take up space in Lind’s mind as the tales are dense and elaborate.
>
> Lind also has a flask filled with **Iðunn’s mead**, which heals her injuries and helps to clear fatigue. She starts with **2 sips** of mead.
>
> Amy’s now finished creating her new skald, Lind, who’s equipped and ready to set off into a strange new world.
>



##  Concepts of Play

### Background

What you did in a previous life and what equipment you begin with.

Your **key item** grants unique skills but your new life is yours to carve, so change approach by changing your key item.

### Saves

A roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances.

Roll a d20 against an appropriate ability score. If you roll *equal to or under* the score, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A 1 always succeeds, and a 20 always fails.

In some situations, saves are made with a bonus or penalty. Roll two d20s, take the lower result (bonus, **advantage)** or higher (penalty, **disadvantage)**.

### Resilience (Res)

The ability to avoid damage in combat, representing your personal drive, toughness, instinct and survivability.

Resilience is made up of two stats: **Vigour (d6)** and **Vitality (d6).** Damage reduces your **Resilience** and **drinking mead** or **resting at a bonfire** restores it.

If an attack takes your **Resilience** exactly to 0, roll for **Omens**.

### Defence (Def)

Attacks hit automatically, for you and your enemies. Armour determines your Defence and reduces the damage you take.

Shields and similar armour provide a bonus, but only while held or worn.

**Bulky** armour weighs you down and all **Dex** saves have **disadvantage**.

### Mead flask & healing

Filled with mead brewed by the gods and infused with the goddess Iðunn’s everlasting apples.

One sip takes an action and restores **10 Res** and clears **2 points of Fatigue**. Resting at a bonfire replenishes all sips.

You start with **2 sips**. This can be increased by relics or by defeating a powerful enemy or reaching a significant point in a quest.

### Inventory

- You start with **10 inventory slots.**

- **Key items** provide new skills and abilities but you can only carry 1.

- Most items take up **1 slot** and **small** items don’t take up any.

- **Bulky** items take **2 slots** and are two- handed or awkward to carry.

- Anyone with a **full inventory** is reduced to **0 Resilience.**

- You can’t carry more items than your inventory allows.

### Status effects

***Cursed**.* **Resilience** is halved until the curse is lifted or otherwise dispelled.

***Deprived.*** You can’t **recover Resilience** or take **reactions** until you rest at a bonfire.

***Dismembered.*** Lost arm: Reduce Str by d4, reduce total inventory slots by 1, and wield only one item at a time.

Lost leg: Reduce Dex by d6 and halve movement speed.

Limb loss is not permanent; resting at a bonfire restores lost appendages.

***Poisoned.*** Take damage every turn, bypassing **Def**; a successful **Str** save or resting at a **bonfire** cleanses the poison.

***Toxic.*** Adds toxic (1 slot) to your inventory. For every point of toxic, lose 1 Str damage each turn, bypassing Def. Purge toxin by resting at a bonfire.

### Fatigue

Your actions and items weigh heavily on you and fatigue can easily overwhelm.

**Fatigue** is gained by casting **spells,** using some **skills,** and **monster attacks**.

Each **Fatigue** occupies **1 inventory slot** and lasts until you rest at a **bonfire**.

### Clearing fatigue

During a moment of calm, spend **1 soul** to clear **d4** points of **Fatigue (**see **Souls)**.

You can also attempt to clear **Fatigue** by reflecting on your ancestors, meditating in nature, singing a song, or through other forms of introspection.

Roll a **d6**. If you roll under your current Vigour (**success**), clear that many points of **Fatigue**. If you roll over (**failure**), you lose **1 point** of **Vigour.**

You can attempt to **clear Fatigue** in this manner once per day.

### Bonfires

Bonfires offer a beacon of hope to souls lost in the dark.

Resting at a bonfire restores lost **Resilience**, clears **Fatigue** from your inventory, and resets **ability score loss**.

Bonfire rests also return most slain foes to life. Powerful or intelligent foes such as **gods**, **jotunn**, or **dragons** remain dead when defeated.

When sat at a bonfire, you can spend **Souls** to grow your power (see **Spending souls**).

### Death

Prepare to die often. Upon death, you wake at the last bonfire rested at with all your current items.

**Lose** one point of total **Vigour** for every death. If your total **Vigour** reaches 0, you are forever lost to the darkness.

One point of **Vigour** can be restored by a full day communing with a **skald** or by burning a **sacrificial bundle** at a bonfire.

### Souls

The might of the gods has been scattered across the Nine Realms. Fragments of this power exist as **soul remnants**, energy manifested and crystallised into physical form.

You may discover **Soul remnants** in hidden and secret places, in areas of great power, or under the watch of fearsome guardians. **Soul remnants** are **small** and take up no inventory space.

Powerful beings such as **jotunn**, **dragons**, or **demons** may also be imbued with the scattered essence of the gods.

Overcoming these foes, through combat or other means, grants you ephemeral slivers of this power: **souls**.

Breaking a **soul remnant** imbues you with the **souls** held within.

**Souls** are delicate and are discarded when you die. You have one chance to recover dropped **souls** after you wake up at the bonfire. Die again before retrieving them and they’re lost forever.

###  Spending souls

As **souls** represent the innate power of the gods, you can absorb this power to grow stronger.

When resting at a bonfire, you can focus on the imbued power and enhance your might.

While resting, spend 1 soul to permanently increase one of your abilities (**Strength, Dexterity, Wits, or Spirit)** or your **Vitality**.

You can only increase each ability to a maximum of 18 using souls.

### Trade & merchants

Rare merchants and travellers trade in souls and you can barter for goods and services with items or **soul remnants**. Certain spells or relics can also coalesce **soul remnants** from imbued **souls**.

Rare items don’t necessarily fetch a higher price, they’re just harder to find, though the value of items changes depending on the merchant.

### Wealth & treasure

Gold and most coins have little value and most trade is through barter, of either souls or items.

Treasure takes the form of weapons, armour, spells, or relics. It can be a lure, taking Adventurers to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.

##  Combat

### Rounds

- Roughly 10 sec. of in-game time.

- Comprised of **turns**.

### Actions

- On your turn, you can **move** and take an action: **attack, cast a spell**, **move again**, or other reasonable action.

- Standard movement **speed** is 40’.

- Declare actions before rolling dice; if risky, the Warden calls for a save.

- All actions, attacks, and movements occur simultaneously.

### Reactions

- You can **react** to an attack and attempt to block, deflect, or avoid damage.

- You must choose to react before the Warden rolls damage.

- Some reactions are only available through **key items** or **relics.**


Reactions available to all adventurers:

***Roll***. Attempt to roll away, avoiding **all physical damage** (**Dex**, **Fatigue**).

***Withdraw***. Attempt to disengage and retreat (**Dex**):

- Success: **Avoid all damage**.

- Failure: Escape but take damage.

- Enemies may continue to attack.

### Turns

The Warden telegraphs the actions taken by NPCs or monsters.

If surprised at the start of combat, make a **Dex save** to act first. Failure also means you can’t use a **Reaction** in your first turn.

### Attacking & damage

- Attacks hit automatically but armour reduces incoming damage.

- Subtract Def from damage rolls before reducing Resilience.

- **Magic** ignores **mundane armour** but not **magical armour**.

- Unarmed attacks do **d4** damage.

### Attack modifiers

***Damage advantage.*** Attacks from a position of strength (against a helpless foe or through a daring manoeuvre).

***Damage disadvantage.*** Attacks from a position of weakness (through cover or with bound hands).

***Multiple attackers.*** Attackers targeting the same foe all roll damage dice, keeping the single best result.

***Dual and 2-handed weapons.*** Attacks with two weapons or with a 2-handed weapon grant damage advantage.

### Damage modifiers

Some foes are vulnerable to types of magic, strong against certain attacks, or wholly immune to damage.

***Weak.*** Gain ***damage advantage***. ***Resistant.*** Gain ***damage disadvantage***. ***Immune.*** Attack causes ***no damage***.

### Dire strike

Some weapons or enemies have special skills that trigger when rolling **max damage** (i.e. rolling 10 on a d10).

The Warden can also decide the effect of a **dire strike**.

### Blast

Refers to anything from explosions to cleaving onslaughts to a meteor impact.

Strikes all targets in the area; roll separate damage for each target. Roll damage die for the number of targets.

### Ability score loss

If any **ability scores** are reduced to 0, you die. Abilities reset when resting at a bonfire or through magic.

### Critical damage

- Once weakened to **0 Res**, any additional damage reduces **Str** directly and triggers **critical damage.**

- Make a **Str** save to avoid **critical damage**; fail the save and **die.**

- Adventurers, NPCs, and monsters are all subject to critical damage.

###  Death Consequences

On death, you wake up at the last bonfire rested at. You keep all inventory items but drop **souls** where you died.

Once resurrected, you can retrieve dropped **souls** if you reach this location without dying again. At death, dropped **souls** are permanently lost.

### Omens

Messages from spirits, the gods, or the land, and can represent fortune or favour.

When an attack reduces your **Resilience** to exactly 0, this triggers an omen. Roll a d8 on the Omens table to determine the event and outcome.

#### Omens Table

| 1    | A spirit appears to you in the form of an animal. Make a **Spi** save. If you succeed, the animal accompanies you until dawn of the next day. |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2    | Roiling storm clouds gather overhead and a you glimpse a winged shape within. Make a **Wit** save. If you fail, you flee from the shape in terror. |
| 3    | The ground trembles and shakes as if a titan approaches. Make a **Dex** save. If you fail, you're knocked to the ground. |
| 4    | A ghostly figure emerges from the wilderness and shrieks before fading away. Make a **Str** save. If you fail, you lose your hearing until the next day. |
| 5    | You hear the hushed murmur of a thousand voices whispering in unknown tongues. Make a **Wit** save. If you succeed, you gain insight into the future. |
| 6    | As if the dead of winter, your breath billows in a misty cloud as the heat drains from your body. Make a **Str** save. If you fail, gain 2 points of fatigue from the cold. |
| 7    | A lank hooded man in a wide-brimmed hat appears on the horizon, beckoning you forward. Make a **Spi** save. If you fail, you follow the hooded man into a trap. |
| 8    | You hear the howl of an enormous wolf rolling across the landscape, followed by echoing calls in response. Make a **Dex** save. If you pass, the wolves can’t find you. |



## Combat Example

> *Lind the skald enters a darkened ruin, overgrown and ancient. The corridor leads north and she hears shuffling.*
>
> Amy: I walk further down the corridor, steel sword in one hand and runic focus in the other.
>
> Warden: Further down the ruin an armoured form wanders aimlessly, skin decayed and holding a rusted spear. It’s a draugr but hasn’t spotted you.
>
> Amy: I’m going to run up and cut it down with my sword!
>
> Warden: You rush forward and slash the undead thing. Roll damage.
>
> *Amy rolls d6 for her sword (5).*
>
> Warden: The draugr has 1 defence from its armour so it takes 4 damage. The draugr turns and raises its spear!
>
> Amy: I gather my will and unleash the power of the gods through my voice! I shout NO!
>
> *Amy chooses to use Lind’s shout reaction to avoid the attack and rolls d20, looking to roll under 16 Spi (5).*
>
> Warden: A success! Your voice knocks the draugr off balance, deflecting the attack! Gain one fatigue for the shout.
>
> *Amy does and she now has 4 slots left.*
>
> Amy: This thing’s not so tough. I strike out with my sword!
>
> *Amy rolls a d6 for the attack (4).*
>
> Warden: The draugr takes 3 damage—it’s not looking very good! It snarls and thrusts its spear.
>
> Amy: I’ll take the hit since I’ve got decent defence.
>
> *The Warden rolls d6 for damage (5). They subtract Lind’s defence (2).*
>
> Warden: Oof! You take 3 damage.
>
> Amy: Grr, that’s it. I clutch the runic focus tightly and weave a tale of Thor the thunderer. Lightning spear!
>
> *Amy rolls a d8 for her spell (5). She marks another fatigue.*
>
> Warden: Magic bypasses the draugr’s armour for full damage. The attack reduces its Res below 0, so it takes the remaining 4 damage to Str. The draugr needs to make a critical damage Str save or die!
>
> *The warden rolls a d20 (16), failing to roll under the new Str score (7).*
>
> Warden: It crumples to the ground, a blackened husk. You’ve defeated it!
>
> Amy: Yes! Does the body have anything on it?
>
> Warden: Before you can search, your spell draws the attention of another draugr. It shuffles out of the darkness, holding a rotted bow. Roll a Dex save to see if you can react to avoid it!
>
> *Amy rolls her d20 (16). Failure, since her Dex is 14!*
>
> Warden: You try to step back but aren’t quick enough and the arrow strikes you in the arm.
>
> *The warden rolls a d6 for damage (4). They subtract Lind’s defence (2).*
>
> Warden: You take 2 damage. A second draugr shambles beside the first, spear in hand. What do you do?
>
> Amy: They’re undead right? I throw my bottle of sacred waters!
>
> *Amy rolls a d10 twice for damage, one for each draugr (9,4). Amy remove the sacred waters from her inventory, freeing up a slot.*
>
> Warden: The bottle breaks on the first draugr’s armour and splashes over them both for magic blast damage. The first takes 9, bringing it under 0 and reducing its Str by 1.
>
> *The warden rolls a d20 for the draugr’s critical damage save (1).*
>
> Warden: A critical success! The first draugr is still up but at -1 Res. The second sizzles as it takes 4 damage.
>
> Both lurch forward, spears raised! Unless you avoid it, they’ll hit with damage advantage.
>
> Amy: I grip the runic focus and scream a curse from the gods, using my shout to deflect the attacks.
>
> *Amy makes a Spi save by rolling a d20*
>
> *(18). Failure! She gains another fatigue.*
>
> Warden: You struggle to remember the tale and the shout fails to deflect the attack.
>
> *The warden rolls a d6 twice for the spear attacks (4,6). They take the higher number (6), because both draugr are attacking the same target.*
>
> Warden: Bad luck, a dire strike! One of the spears strikes your chest and the other pins you to the ground. You can’t move for one turn.
>
> *They subtract Lind’s defence.* Warden: You take 4 damage. Amy: I’m at -2!
>
> Warden: You lose 2 Strength. Make a critical damage save to see if you stay on your feet!
>
> *Amy rolls a d20, hoping to beat her newly reduced Str score of 7 (20). A critical failure!*
>
> Warden: You died! The draugr watches your lifeless body collapse to the ground and it slowly lurches away. The world fades to black…
>
> …You awaken at a roaring bonfire. Your wounds are healed but you lose 1 Vigour.
>
> *Amy marks her sheet, cursing her bad luck. She has 3 Vigour left. Her total Resilience is now 6.*
>
> Amy: This means the draugr I killed are back alive—er, on their feet again, doesn’t it?
>
> Warden: That’s right. But at least now you have an idea what to expect.
>
> *Amy furrows her brow and grips her pencil tighter.*
>
> Amy: Let’s do this!
>



## Magic

Magic is a remnant of the gods and draws attention when used. There are some who see magic as proof the gods live on in the new world.

***Runestones**.* Smooth and delicately polished stones with an inscribed spell hand-etched in runes. Used by seers to affect magical change in the world.

***Sagas.*** Not a physical object, but a learned and memorised tale passed down from the gods. Skalds can recite sagas to channel the power of the gods through speech.

***Flame runes*.** Words of power inscribed on fire grippers that allow pyres to shape and control flame.

**Runestones** and **sagas** contain a single spell and take up one slot. They cannot be transcribed or created; instead they are recovered from places like tombs, dungeons, and ruins. **Fire grippers** can only store one flame rune at a time and they are exceedingly rare.

### Scrolls

Similar to runestones and sagas, however:

- They do not take up inventory slots.

- They do not cause fatigue.

- They disappear after one use.

### [Casting spells](#casting-spells)

**Seers** cast spells by holding a runestone in one hand and a staff in the other. They read the spell from the runestone and focus the magic through the staff.

**Skalds** cast spells by holding a **runic focus** and speaking the **saga** aloud.

**Pyres** cast spells by channelling fire through their **grippers**.

Casting all types of magic takes a toll. After every spell, add a **Fatigue** to inventory, occupying 1 slot.

Given time and safety, you can *enhance* a spell (e.g., affecting multiple targets, increasing its power, etc.) without any additional cost.

If **deprived** or in danger, the Warden may require you to make either a **Wit** or **Spi** save (depending on the spellcaster) to avoid any ill-effects from casting.

Consequences of failure are on par with the intended effect, and may result in added **Fatigue**, the destruction of the **runestone**, the **saga** slipping from memory, injury, or death.

Only spells that cause **Fatigue** are subject to ill effects.

### Relics

Items imbued with a magical spell or power. They do not cause fatigue. Relics usually have a limited use, as well as a recharge condition.

**Eye of Oðinn**, *1 charge*. Crystalline orb with brilliant red flaw. Grants a glimpse into a chosen realm. **Recharge**: Bathe the Eye in the tears of a god.

**Mischief Horn**, *3 charges*. Delicate curved bronze horn. Blow to cause two random people within the sound of the horn to swap bodies for a day.

**Mistletoe Dart**, *1 charge*. Vibrant leaves conceal a wickedly sharp thistle. When thrown, flies to any named target but lands harmlessly before them. **Recharge**: Witness a kiss of true love.

**Skull Beacon**, *1 charge*. Charred and crumbling skull with a dim glimmer in the sockets. Glows brightly when held. **Recharge**: burn on a roaring bonfire.

**Staff of Walking Weald**, *1 charge*. Crooked staff speckled with soft moss. Temporarily animates a plant or tree. **Recharge**: bury underneath the oldest tree in the forest for one week.

###  Rings

Many magical rings may be found but none of them should be used lightly.

Adventurers can wear up to two rings at a time, one on each hand.

***Iron Ring.*** Dense ring wrought from blackened iron. Gain 1 additional defence but lose 10 speed.

***Red Berserkr Ring.*** Crudely shaped bone ring with a glinting rough cut ruby. Re-roll 1s on damage dice for melee attacks but lose all defence bonus from armour.

***Ring of the Mists.*** Exquisite Dwarven-crafted silver ring carved with undecipherable runes. Allows the bearer to travel between the realms of the living and the dead but draws the attention of untold horrors.

***Sylva’s Ring.*** Delicate wooden ring entwined by sharp thorns. Gain **2** extra **inventory slots** but lose **1 vigour**.

##  Advanced Rules

### Introduction

The **Core Rules** are meant for introductory play and fit best with players new to Runecairn or TTRPGs in general.

The **Advanced Rules** are for more experienced players, or those looking for a different type of challenge or playstyle.

### Advanced backgrounds

The **Advanced Rules** introduces two new backgrounds: **berserkr** and **pyre**.

***Berserkr.*** Ferocious and powerful, wade into battle with no armour upon your back, wielding a massive two-handed sword and call upon the power of beasts to strengthen your attacks.

***Pyre**.* Shape flame as a blacksmith shapes iron, calling upon ravenous fire to burn and purge and channel primal forces through your own two hands.

**BEYOND TWO PLAYERS**

Although Runecairn was designed for 2 players (one **Warden** and one **Adventurer**), you may also choose to play with 1 (**solo**) or with 3 or more (1 **Warden** and 2 or more **Adventurers**).

#### Solo play

Balance favour and sorrow or read the runes to guide your way through a pre- written adventure (such as ***Beneath the Broken Sword***), or conjure a random dungeon crawl with the **delve generator**.

***Oracle.*** Whether you require answers to simple questions or more complex queries, the **Oracle tables** help you along the skein and carve your own fate.

### Delve generator

Create small, medium, or large dungeons, whether used by solo Adventurers for **one-off dungeon crawls** or by Wardens when populating a **campaign** with new dungeons.

#### Cooperation

Navigating the world of Runecairn can be a lonely endeavour, but thankfully there are kindred spirits available to assist with jolly cooperation.

Useful if the world proves too difficult for one Adventurer, or if a second player wants to join your game, summon another Adventurer from the world of the dead or a distant realm to fight alongside you.

#### Invasions

Conversely, if the Adventurer seeks a greater challenge or if another player wants to join the game temporarily, vengeful spirits in the form of **black fetches** invade the world of the Adventurer and attempt to defeat them.

Best used judiciously for greatest impact or effect, as the world is a dangerous enough place even without spectral assassins.



## Advanced Backgrounds

### Berserkr

In another life you might have leaped raging into battle, striking fear in friend and foe alike, or hunted the wilderness for death and glory. You refused all armour and blood sang in your ears.

In combat, none could match your ferocity, you howled like a wild beast and gnashed your teeth while striking down opponents twice your size.

In the time before, you were at home on the battlefield but now your home is wherever you wish it to be.

**Berserkr (Str, 0 Def)**

| Beaststone       | key, rare, charge, rage    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Grave sword      | d10, bulky, frenzy, sunder |
| Fur cloak        | 0 Def, small               |
| Sacred stockfish | rare                       |
| Free slots       | 6                          |

**Skills**

***Charge (reaction)***. Drive your shoulder into your opponent; **Str** save to disrupt the attack and take no damage **(Fatigue).**

***Frenzy*.** The ferocity of your attack staggers your opponent; non-undead targets need to make a **Spi** save or falter momentarily, allowing you to make an **extra attack (Fatigue).**

***Rage***. Call upon your animal spirit which imbues you with bestial strength; for d4 rounds, gain **3 Def** and make all melee attacks at **double damage**. When the rage ends, make a **Spi** save (you can choose to fail):

- **Success**: The spirit departs and you regain control; add **2 Fatigue.**

- **Failure**: The beast takes control; lose **1 Spirit** and continue to rage with a **50% chance** to attack **friendly targets.**

***Sunder*.** Tear through your opponent’s armour for **d4 damage**; first occurrence causes target to lose **1 Def (Fatigue).**



### Pyre

In another life you might have burned spirits from the dead, stoked the smithy’s forge, or battled frost demons in the mountains.

Your hands channelled the spark of life and the cleansing fire of death. Your magic is the oldest of all, furious and hungry.

In combat, you sear and scald your foes, madness dancing just behind your eyes. Your charred plated leather marked both your calling and profession.

The age of fire was long ago, but the wheel yet turns. Whether enlightenment or destruction, your path is now yours to forge.

**Pyre (Spi, 1 Def)**

| Fire grippers     | key, rare, bulky, d6, flameshield, ignite |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Plated leather    | 1 Def                                     |
| Blacksmith hammer | rare, d6, smash                           |
| Flame rune        | *Sear*                                    |
| Kindled bale      | rare                                      |
| Free slots        | 5                                         |

**Skills**

***Flameshield (reaction)*.** Manifest a fiery shield in your offhand to deflect an attack; **Spi** save to avoid all damage **(Fatigue).**

***Ignite*.** Channel ancient magic to ignite your weapon (or gloves) in blazing fire; for the duration of the fight, melee attacks do **double damage** and bypass **mundane armour**, ignoring **Def (Fatigue).**

***Smash*.** Bludgeon your opponent with **damage advantage**; target needs to make **Str** save or be knocked down **(Fatigue).**

***Sear* (flame rune).** Emit a blazing stream of violent flame, burning your target for **d8 damage**, 60ft range **(Fatigue).**



##  Solo Play

### Introduction

Runecairn can also be played solo, with one player acting as both **Warden** and **Adventurer**.

Journey through an existing adventure like ***Beneath the Broken Sword*** or use the **delve generator** to build a dungeon crawl.

When you reach a moment of choice or conflict, a time when you’d normally look to the Warden for the outcome, consider consulting an **Oracle**, a method of deriving meaning from randomness.

An Oracle can be tarot cards, an online resource, or a mobile app.

**Wardensaga** includes a set of random tables that serves as Oracle, offering a way to interpret rolls and the runes of the Younger Futhark into the result of a choice or action.

### Journalling

Chronicle your journey in a journal or diary. Be as brief or descriptive as you like—this is a saga of your Adventurer, translated and retold through the ages.

Use the **Delve Generator** sheet (from the **Runecairn website**) to document encounters and map your delve.

### Favour or Sorrow

If an outcome isn’t immediately clear, ask the Oracle. For a simple yes or no answer (“Does the troll see me?”) or a straight- forward check (“Will the warrior help me?”), roll **2d6** on **Favour or Sorrow** (next page).

An outcome of **favour** is broadly positive while an outcome of **sorrow** is broadly negative. A **complication** adds an extra obstacle or development to the outcome.

For instance, you convince the warrior to help you but they demand one of your weapons as payment.

### Reading the Runes

For complex questions, or more nuanced interactions, read the runes.

First, gather your will and **focus**. Narrow that focus to a singular **emotion** and concentrate on the runes of the Younger Futhark—one **rune** reveals itself.

- Roll **d10** on the **Focus** table.

- Roll **d8** on the **Emotion** table.

- Finally, roll **d20** on the **Rune** table.

Reflect upon the resulting words and turn them over in your mind. Focus your emotion on the name of the rune. Your answer takes shape.

For instance, Amy wants to investigate a severed spectral head floating through crumbling ruins.

She rolls 3 dice: **d10** for **Focus** (4, *Overcome*), **d8** for **Emotion** (6, *Forlorn*), and **d20** for **Rune** (11, *Ice*).

This gives her *Overcome Forlorn Ice*. She interprets this as a sign to ignore the fear in her heart and approach the cursed head with an open mind.

#### Favour or Sorrow Table

| 2d6  | Outcome                  |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| 2    | Favour                   |

## Delve Generator

Use when playing solo or as a Warden to generate an adventure or campaign.

1.  Roll **d6** on the **Delve** table for dungeon **type**, **size, and bonfires**. Delve size varies but all have at least **10 encounters.** Note **delve size**.

2.  Roll **d6** on the **Objectives** table.

3.  Roll **d12** on the **Encounters** table in each new area.

4.  When you first interact with a monster or NPC, roll **2d6** on **NPC Reactions**.

5.  For dynamic enemies, roll **2d6** on the **Enemy Actions** table. Some enemies fight to the death (i.e. undead) but most flee when in danger.

6.  Clear an area and reduce your **delve size** by 1. At 1, roll **d6** on the **Resolution** table to:

    - Reach your **objective.**

    - Find a **clue** to its location.

    - Encounter a **setback** that halts your progress.

Keep rolling encounters until you locate your objective. For every area cleared, roll on the **Resolution** table, with -1 for every **clue** and +1 for every **setback**. Delves fail after 4 setbacks.

7.  Once you’ve located your objective, the real challenge begins.

**Bonfires**

Place one at the start of the delve and, depending on the dungeon size, 1 or 2 more throughout.

## Cooperation

The world of **Runecairn** can be a solitary one, but a helping hand can be a ray of hope in even the darkest place.

If you want to traverse the world with a friend by your side, seek out an **effigy stone**.

### Summoning an ally

When resting at a bonfire, you can use an **effigy stone** to call out to a fallen hero and summon them for aid at the cost of **1 Vigour**.

Effigy stones are exceedingly rare and finding one is an adventure itself. Each stone corresponds to a specific hero, as their name and history is carved upon the limestone figure.

The effigy stone reaches out across the realms and summons a physical manifestation of the hero’s spirit, who joins the Adventurer at the bonfire.

Summoned allies can be past or future Adventurers run by a **2nd player** or an additional **hero** controlled by the **player**.

### Combat and healing

The summoned ally fights alongside the Adventurer. When attacking the same target, roll damage for both attackers and take the higher result.

On enemy turns, the Warden states the target for each attack, giving each Adventurer an opportunity for a **Reaction**.

Summoned allies have flasks with **1 sip of mead**, refilled as normal at bonfires.

###  Death and rebirth

Summoned allies are tied to the Adventurer who summoned them. If the **Adventurer** dies, the summoned ally returns to their home.

They can be summoned again in the same manner, but with the same cost.

The ally’s physical body is a mortal shape. If a **summoned ally** dies, their spirit dissipates into mist and they return home.

During combat the Adventurer can cry out to the old gods and **sacrifice** **1 Vigour** to revive their summoned ally.



## Invasions

Just as there are benevolent heroes across the realms willing to help out an adventurer in need, so are there malevolent forces who seek to sow chaos and destruction.

A **black fetch** invades an adventurer’s world and stalks them, seeking to strip their humanity and vigour.

### Black fetch

Much like summoned allies, a **black fetch** is a physical manifestation of a spectral form, often the crestfallen spirit of a dead adventurer or projection of a powerful figure from another realm.

A black fetch can be a fallen Adventurer run by a **2nd player** or dark spirit controlled by the **Warden**.

Consider confronting a player with a previously slain Adventurer or NPC returned as a black fetch.

### Combat, healing, and death

Fetches follow the same rules as **summoned allies** and also have a mead flask with 1 sip.

Fetches continue to invade in the same area unless defeated. As they are spectral beings and do not fear death, they do not flee from combat.

When a black fetch is defeated, their spectral form dissipates and their spirit is forever banished from the area.

### Repelling an invader

If a black fetch is successfully defeated, they reward **1 Soul** or an important item they held in life, such as a weapon, spell, or relic.

**Safety check**

As with any situation with potential conflict between players, check with everyone at the table first. Is everyone aware of the possible player vs. player scenario and comfortable with combat between players? If not, reconsider Invasions.

### Pronunciation Guide

Icelandic is close to Old Norse in structure but different in pronunciation. For simplicity, Icelandic spelling and pronunciation is used for non-English words in this text.

| Letter | Explanation                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Á      | “ou” in “house,” “about” and “shout.”                        |
| Ð      | “th” in “feather,” “father” and “that,” but as the last letter of a word it is like “th” in “thin.” |
| É      | same as English “yay.”                                       |
| Í      | an English “ee” and the “i” in “Maria” and the “y” in “diary.” |
| Ó      | “o” in “sole” and like “oa” in “goat” and “soap.”            |
| Ú      | English “oo” as in “zoo.”                                    |
| Ý      | Icelandic “í,” it's only a matter of spelling.               |
| Þ      | English “th” in “thunder”, “theatre” and “thong.”            |
| Æ      | the name of the letter “i” in English or the sound of the letters “ai” in the words “Thai food.” Hi/hæ & bye/bæ are the same in English and Icelandic. |
| Ö      | German “ö” and English “u” in “urgent” or “fur.” Equivalent to English "e" as in “bed,” but with the lips rounded. |
