## Introduction

### Stat Blocks


#### Monster type

Icon depicting the type of monster; this determines behavioural or mechanical differences.


#### Resilience

The ability to avoid damage in combat. If Resilience drops below 0, the target starts taking Str damage.


#### Defence

Reduces damage to Resilience from mundane (non-magical) attacks.


#### Ability scores

Strength, Dexterity, Wits, and Spirit. Determines physical, mental, and spiritual attributes. 


#### Movement speed

How far the creature can move in one turn, measured in feet.

### Attack Types


#### Blast

Attacks that affect all targets in the area; roll damage separately for each target. 
If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the damage die for a result.


#### Magical attacks

Listed in *italic*, these attacks bypass defence and ignore armour.


#### Dire strike

Special effect triggered when rolling max damage on a damage die (i.e., 10 on a d10).

### Damage Modifiers

Some monsters are particularly strong against certain attacks, vulnerable to types of magic, or wholly immune to mundane (i.e. non-magical) damage.

**Resistant.** Attacks of this type are made with **damage disadvantage**.

**Weak.** Attacks of this type are made with **damage advantage**.

**Immune.** Attacks of this type do **no damage**.


#### Status Effects

**Cursed.** Resilience is halved until the curse is lifted or otherwise dispelled.

**Deprived.** You can’t recover Resilience or take reactions until you rest at a bonfire.

**Dismembered.** Losing an arm decreases your Str by d4, reduces total inventory slots by 1, and limits you to wielding one item at a time.

Losing a leg reduces your Dex by d6 and halves your movement speed.

Limb loss is not permanent; resting at a bonfire will restore lost appendages.

**Poisoned.** Take damage every turn, bypassing Def; a successful Str save or resting at a bonfire cleanses the poison.

**Toxic.** Adds toxic (1 slot) to your inventory. For every point of toxic, lose 1 Str damage each turn, bypassing Def. Purge toxic by resting at a bonfire.



### Monster Types


#### Humanoid

Thinking and self-aware, often organising in communities or settlements, whether humans, elves, dwarves, trolls, or other ancestries.

Behaviour and attitude varies amongst different groups. Attempt to flee if their lives are threatened.


#### Beast

Wild animals, living in nature.

Typically won't attack unless hunting or provoked. Attempt to flee if their lives are threatened.


#### Colossus

Towering, monstrous figures created by the gods, once used as guardians and protectors, now left to run amok.


#### Demon

Children of chaos, innately formed through magic, often possessing elemental properties.


#### Dragon

Gargantuan serpents, often thousands of years old. Most slumbering or slain, now figures of legend and lore. Intelligent, though without language.

Attack adventurers if confronted. Unlikely to flee if their lives are threatened.


#### Horror

Natural forms twisted and corrupted by ancient magic or meddling of the gods.


#### Jotunn

Powerful supernatural beings in opposition to the gods. Mistakenly considered giants, though they vary greatly in size.

Most are intelligent, considerate beings but many suffered irreparable damage during the great wars.

Unpredictable, but defend themselves if attacked. May flee if their lives are threatened.


#### Ooze

Shapeless forms, the by-product of ancient magic, lost and forgotten. Absorb the essence of their environments.


#### Spirit

Supernatural beings representing the primordial forces of nature, whether on land, in the sea, in fire, or in air. Some exist in physical form, others in incorporeal essence. Some are intelligent, others exist as pure emotion.

Many delight in tormenting adventurers. May flee if their lives are threatened.


#### Undead

Those who walk after death, many animated with a burning hatred of the living. Some exist in physical form, others in incorporeal essence.

Immune to sleep or other mind-altering magic.


#### Legendary

Gargantuan titans who roam the known world, staggeringly powerful and nearly immortal.

## Appendix

### Creating Monsters

Use the following template for modelling any new monster or NPC:


#### Name

###### X **Res** | X **Def** | X **Str** | X **Dex** | X **Wit** | X **Spi** | Xft | weapon or special ability (dX, qualities)

- Evocative description.
- Behaviour, location, and/or quirks.
- Special ability or dire strike consequence.


#### General Principles

- Give average creatures 4 Res, hardy ones 8 Res, and serious threats 12+ Res; the biggest threats also have high Str scores.
- Use flavour and style to help adversaries stand out. Players remember an absent-minded rock troll more easily than a generic human bandit.
- Add **dire strike** abilities for attacks dealing more than d8 damage, to increase the threat and make the creature more memorable.
- Humanoids have a standard speed of 40ft; bigger creatures are slower, smaller creatures are quicker.
- Remember: Resilience is the ability to avoid damage in combat, through determination and vitality, whereas Strength represents physical toughness.


#### Ability Score Guidance

###### 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, 18 is outstanding, and 20+ is mythical.

- Good at avoiding damage? +Res.
- Armoured? +Def.
- Strong? +Str.
- Nimble? +Dex.
- Smart? +Wit.
- Self-assured? +Spi.
- Most animals and non-thinking creatures have a Wit score of 3-6.
- Undead creatures have a Spi score of 1-6.


#### Bosses

Consider adding damage resistances, immunities, and dire strike abilities.

For extra challenge, add magical attacks that bypass adventurer armour.


#### Which Monsters Respawn?

Generally, lower level enemies respawn when the adventurer rests at a bonfire. More powerful creatures, unique monsters/NPCs, and bosses do not.

Consider factors like the area, what other types of enemies are around, location of the nearest bonfire, etc.

### Converting Monsters


#### Cairn/Into the Odd

- HP → Resilience
- Will → Wits or Spirit
- Armour → Defence
- Critical damage → Dire strike

Magic does not bypass armour in **Cairn** or **Into the Odd**, so consider increasing Res or Str accordingly**.**


#### We Deal in Lead

- Grit → Resilience
- Heart → Wits or Spirit

Critical damage effects become dire strike attacks.


#### Wits and Spirit

Consider the Ability Score Guidance when converting Will or Heart into Wits/Spirit; for powerful creatures, roll d6+10 for the other ability score.


#### OSR

- Str and Con (average) → Strength
- Int →Wits
- Wis and Cha (average) → Spirit
- 1 Res per HD for creatures.
- Humanoids have at least 4 Res.
- Morale can be used as a baseline.

For armour (AC): light armour (leather) gives 1 Def, medium (chainmail) gives 2 Def, and heavy (plate) gives 3 Def. Shields add +1 Def.

Damage dice are roughly equivalent (armed attacks do at least d6 damage).


#### Converting to Other Systems

Follow the same guidance but in reverse. Keep in mind that other systems may not have adventurer respawning, so encounters are likely much deadlier.
