**Runecairn** is based on **Into the Odd** and **Cairn**, sharing many similar rules and mechanics. You can run adventures designed for **Cairn** and **Into the Odd** (along with other Odd descendants like **Mausritter**, **Liminal Horror**, and **We Deal in Lead**) with Runecairn adventurers, though there are some guidelines to bear in mind.

#### General Guidelines

- Runecairn Adventurers are more resilient than other characters and persist after death. Consider tweaking the challenge to best fit the group.
- For bonfires, place one at the beginning of a dungeon and at least one on each floor. Place a bonfire after a significant challenge is overcome (ie. after defeating a boss).
- Swap out gold treasure for soul remnants.

#### Cairn

- Treat spellbooks the same, though roll SPI rather than WIL.

## Converting Monsters

#### Ability score guidance

- Is it good at avoiding damage? Give it Res.
- Does it soak damage? Give it DEF.
- Is it strong? Give it a high STR.
- Is it nimble? Give it high DEX.
- Is it clever? Give it high WIT.
- Is it charismatic? Give it high SPI.

#### Cairn/Into the Odd

- HP → Resilience
- Will → Wits or Spirit
- Consider the Ability score guidance when converting Will or Heart into Wits/Spirit; for powerful creatures, roll d6+10 for the other ability score.
- Armour → Defence
- Critical damage → Dire strike

Magic does not bypass armour in Cairn or Into the Odd, so consider increasing Res or Str accordingly.

#### We Deal in Lead

- Grit → Resilience
- Heart → Wits or Spirit

Critical damage effects become dire strike attacks.

#### OSR

- Str and Con (average) → Strength
- Int →Wits
- Wis and Cha (average) → Spirit
- 1 Res per HD for creatures.
- Humanoids have at least 4 Res.
- Most undead have less than 3 WIT and most animals have less than 6.
- Morale can be used as a baseline.

For armour (AC): light armour (leather) gives 1 Def, medium (chainmail) gives 2 Def, and heavy (plate) gives 3 Def. Shields add +1 Def.

Damage dice are roughly equivalent (armed attacks do at least d6 damage).

#### Converting to Other Systems

Follow the same guidance but in reverse. Other systems may not have adventurer respawning, so encounters are likely much deadlier.
