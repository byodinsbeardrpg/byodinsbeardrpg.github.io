Hi, I’m Colin (he/him), a Canadian game designer living in mist-shrouded Yorkshire, England.

I was introduced to roleplaying as a teenager, starting with 2nd Edition and swiftly moving on to all manner of strangeness such as TMNT and Heroes Unlimited.

After a 20 year hiatus, I picked tabletop gaming back up again, moving from 3.5e to Pathfinder, 5th Edition, and the OSR.

My adventures tend to be inspired by folklore and filled with nasty gribblies looking to pull travellers into the dark. You can see more of my work at [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/15858/By-Odin039s-Beard) and [itch.io](https://byodinsbeardrpg.itch.io/).

A lifelong fan of Norse mythology and long-time beardbearer, I decided to name my imprint By Odin’s Beard RPG.
